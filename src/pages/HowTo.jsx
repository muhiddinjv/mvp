      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">HOW TO MEMORIZE</h2>

      <p className='mb-2'>Let's say you want to memorize, the ayah 64 from Surah 36 Ya-Sin. First, set the language to English. I will explain why later. Then...</p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
        <li className='mb-4'>
          <strong>Repeat</strong> - Tap / click the repeat button  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowsRotate} />  and it does it's magic like this:
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6 mb-2">
            <li>it plays the 1st word 1 time, and then...</li>
            <li>it plays the 1st & 2nd words 2 times, and then...</li>
            <li>it plays the 1st, 2nd and 3rd words 3 times, and so on...</li>
          </ol>
          <p className='mb-2'>The number of repetitions increases depending the number of words because the more words there are in an ayah, the harder it is to memorize it.</p>
          <p>If you double-tap on a word, it gets highlighted with a <span className='border'>border</span>. When you tap the repeat button <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowsRotate} />, it plays all the words upto this word only once and start repeating from this word onwards.</p>
        </li>
        <li className='mb-4'>
          <strong>Review</strong> - Once you have listened through all the words at least once, start reviewing:
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6">
            <li>Repeat the Arabic translation of each English word / phrase in your head.</li>
            <li>If you can't remember, tap / click on the word / phrase to hear its Arabic translation.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li className='mb-4'>
          <strong>Refine</strong> - When you are able to recite all the words without looking at the ayah, tap the play button <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlay} /> and recite along with the audio to fine-tune your pronunciation. The audio keeps replaying until it reaches 10 reps but you can stop it at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bookmark</strong> - You can bookmark <FontAwesomeIcon icon={bookMarkOff} /> the ayahs you are memorizing to revisit them later.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">HOW TO REVIEW</h3>

      <p className='mb-2'>You can review the surahs you've memorized in 3 ways by tapping á€‘ button to limit the number of words in every ayah to:</p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li><strong>Easy</strong> - 7 or 5 words.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal</strong> - 3 words.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard</strong> - 1 word while keeping all the accordions (+) closed.</li>
      </ol>
